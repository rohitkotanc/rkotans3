### <ins>Description</ins>: *This scenario consists of four nodes:  CAR_VALUE, QUADCOPTER_UAV_VALUE, CELL_TOWER_POLE_VALUE and CELL_TOWER_VALUE. Using the waypoint mobility model, the car and quadcopter rotate around the cell tower pole which is inside the cell tower. The graph (UDP Echo Client Throughput) shows the communication (time vs bytes/sec).*

### <ins>Description</ins>: *This scenario consists of three CAR_VALUE nodes. Using the constant velocity mobility model, two cars move at a constant speed past a stationary car. The client graph (UDP Echo Client Throughput) shows the communication of the moving cars with the stationary one while the server graph (UDP Echo Server Throughput) represents the stationary car (time vs bytes/sec).*

### <ins>Description</ins>: *This scenario consists of three CAR_VALUE nodes. Using the constant velocity mobility model, two cars move at a constant speed with a stationary car in the middle. The stationary car which acts as an obstacle causes a dip in connectivity. The client graph (UDP Echo Client Throughput) shows the communication of the moving cars with the stationary one while the server graph (UDP Echo Server Throughput) represents the stationary car (time vs bytes/sec).*

### <ins>Description</ins>: *This scenario consists of three CAR_VALUE nodes. Using the constant velocity mobility model, two cars move at a constant speed with a stationary car on the left. The stationary car acting as server loses full connectivity with the right most car acting as client. The client graph (UDP Echo Client Throughput) shows the communication of the right most car with the stationary one while the server graph (UDP Echo Server Throughput) represents the stationary car (time vs bytes/sec).*
