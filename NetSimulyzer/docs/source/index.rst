The *NetSimulyzer* application is an offline playback tool to display scenarios in 3D, much like
`NetAnim <https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/NetAnim>`_. It supports topology features,
such as Nodes and Buildings, and additional items to further
understanding of the scenario, such as marked areas, a logging system
and charting.

The application replays a *ns-3* scenario after it has been run using a
JSON file, which is generated by
`the companion ns-3 module <https://github.com/usnistgov/NetSimulyzer-ns3-module>`_,
and then loaded into this application. For instructions on how to generate this file,
see the `README <https://github.com/usnistgov/NetSimulyzer-ns3-module/blob/master/README.md>`_
for the *ns-3* module.
